Lab 1a:

Our code is to some extent robust (at least it can pass the two test scripts: ‘ok’ and ‘bad’), but it is not guaranteed to cover all corner cases.

New Feature:
It records the line number of wrong commands, starting from Line #1.
e.g: Line 6: Incomplete ‘while’ statement, missing 'done’.

Lab 1a - Design Problem:

-The code is getting more robust after modifying some functions related to determine command type, and will cover more extreme cases.
-The new modified code in design problem can support five more command types based on lab1a:
    AND_COMMAND,   // A && B
    OR_COMMAND,    // A || B
    CASE_COMMAND,  // case A in B) C ;; D) E ;; esac
    FOR_COMMAND,   // for A in B do C done
    NOT_COMMAND,   // !A
-The code modifies the structure of command according to the new command type, but it will not affect the correctness of lab1a.
-The code can perform command construction based on the precedence of operator instead of from left to right order.
-The code modify the print function so as to print the five new types of commands, sticking the same print style as the basic seven command types.
